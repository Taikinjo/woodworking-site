# Dad’s Woodworks — Personal Project

This is a small web project I built for my dad’s woodworking business.  
It’s a simple, static website designed to showcase his handmade furniture and custom woodcrafts.

The site includes:
- A clean **home page** introducing his work  
- A **project gallery** with multiple photos and descriptions for each piece  
- An **about page** sharing his background and workshop story  
- A **contact page** for inquiries and commissions  

I created this project using basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks or CMS.  
It was a great learning experience in designing, structuring, and deploying a static website from scratch.

### 💡 Notes
This site is lightweight and runs entirely in the browser.
